# Worldpainter-trees
A collection of worldpainter trees (.schem) made explicitly for worldpainter and to be survival-friendly.
currently containing 16 layers making up 11 different biomes.

## Shameless self-promotion
Have a look at my [worldpainter scripts](https://sijmen-v-b.gumroad.com/) I especially think Fixify would be useful to **you**.

I have also made a [tool to easily make villager NPCs](https://conversationengine.ddns.net/?page=ConversationEngine) which I'm quite proud of.

## Survival-friendly
By survival friendly we mean that the trees are:
 - Build with decayable leaves.
   - So, no floating leaves.
 - Are not annoying to chop down:
   - Mostly log blocks.
   - Non-log blocks are close to the logs and hard to miss.
   - No more than 4 aesthetic blocks per tree (think fences etc.).
 - Trees have roots, so they can spawn on slopes.

## ...easy import.world
Use the "Import custom layer(s) from another world..." option in worldpainter and select the ...easy import.world file to quickly import all the provided (custom object) layers.

## Images
for previews of the layers look on the planet Minecraft page: [coming "soonâ„¢"]

## How to download
you can either download the "...easy import.world" or click on the green code button on the top and click "Download ZIP" to download the entire repository.

# Layers belonging together
Some of the layers are meant to be used together. you do not have to use them together but it is recommended.

## Jungle
The jungle trees in the "thick jungle" are quite tall. To make the transition to other biomes one should use the "Jungle Edge" as a transition biome.

## Wooded plateau
The wooded plateau (sub-biome of the Badlands/Mesa) is usually reserved for high elevations. For the lower elevations, we recommend using the "rocks and bushes" layer.

# Additions are welcomed.
Pull requests are welcome if you feel like you have some schematics worth adding. (birch trees, cherry?) 

If you don't know how to make a pull request contact @sijmen_v_b on the [worldpainter discord](https://discord.gg/NrGWtXnra8).
